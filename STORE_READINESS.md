### Known Medium-Priority Issues (non-blocking)
1. `observeBalance()` Flow has no error handler — coroutine dies silently on DB error
2. `SubscriptionViewModel` reads subscription once; doesn't collect Flow
3. TOCTOU race in `purchaseItem()` — balance check outside transaction
4. J Coin sync metadata sent as empty `{}` to Supabase
5. `Settings` and `WordDetail` nav routes defined but not registered
6. Hardcoded 36dp/24dp columns in WeeklyActivityCard may overflow on narrow screens
7. "Backend not configured" error shown to user when Supabase is absent
8. Nested Scaffolds cause FAB overlap on small screens

## Version Roadmap

## Remaining TODO for Store Launch
1. **Visual assets from jayhub:31** — feature graphic + screenshots
2. **Deploy privacy policy** — jworks-ai.com site needs rebuild with EigoQuest privacy page
3. **Data safety form** — fill in Play Console (manual step)
4. **APK size investigation** — 3.2MB seems too small (audio files may not be bundled)
5. **Device testing** — test on real device + multiple screen sizes
